# Welcome to Bus Mall

BusMall is a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel on busses.

BusMall wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell.  Currently, this website is doing marketing analysis to test their potential customer items of interest.

### *Gathering information*

Each user will be asked to choose their favorite item from a series of randomly selected items.   Upon selecting your favorite the images will change, although some images may repeat after a *x-number* of rotations.

After 25 choices have been made, the data analysis will be shown.
